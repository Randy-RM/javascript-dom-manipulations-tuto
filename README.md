This project gathers several mini-apps to help you learn DOM manipulation with JavaScript, featuring a modern flat and accessible design.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `counter-app/`: Counter application (+, -, reset) with flat and responsive design.
- `hide-and-display-app/`: App to show or hide a toy list, with styled buttons and accessibility.
